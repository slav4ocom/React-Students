# React Students

This is web platform for students. Actually it is equivalent of Web Students platform, but instead of using .NET CORE MVC and Entity Framework it uses React.js Node.js express web server module, and soon database will be moved on Mongo DB provider. The goal is to implement MERN stack.

At this initial point of development it uses in browser Babel compiler. Now for tests I use existing MS SQL database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
